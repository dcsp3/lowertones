        <p>
          ReCAPD allows you to find the musicians and artists behind the music you love. To do this we utilise the MusicBrainz database,
          which is a community-driven database of music metadata. The database provides a wealth of information about artists, albums, and
          tracks, and is used by music services and enthusiasts worldwide. If you like our service, consider contributing to MusicBrainz to
          help people learn more about the people behind their music.
          <br /><br />
          We prepopulated our database with 35,000 of the most popular artists and 4.8 million tracks from Spotify. We then needed to
          generate a mapping between the Spotify and MusicBrainz datasets - if you know about these datasets, this is no mean feat. We
          started with the low-hanging fruit - artists with a Spotify URL in their MusicBrainz profile, and then led to a more complex
          process of matching artists based on their name and the names of their albums. The resulting Artist MBID to Spotify mapping for
          the artists is available for download

            >here</a
          >. Once we had the Spotify ID to MusicBrainz ID mapping for artist, we could then move onto mapping MusicBrainz tracks to Spotify
          tracks. <br /><br />
          MusicBrainz kindly offers the ability to host a copy of their database, which we used retrieve song attributions (a.k.a.
          contributors) for all tracks with them on their platform. Due to the nature of our service, we only require a mapping between
          Spotify tracks and MusicBrainz tracks, where the MusicBrainz track has a contributor. The resulting Spotify track to MusicBrainz
          track mapping is available for download

          We have published 2 public REST APIs for access to this dataset:
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>https://team37.bham.team/api/mbid-spotify-song-mapping/spotify-song-id</code>
          <br />- given a Spotify song ID, this will return a MusicBrainz Recording ID, if in our system.
          <br />
          <br />
          <code>https://team37.bham.team/api/mbid-spotify-artist-mapping/spotify-artist-id</code>
          <br />- given a Spotify artist ID, this will return a MusicBrainz Artist ID, if in our system.

          ReCAPD allows you to find the musicians and artists behind the music you love. We scan your Spotify library, and use our
          proprietary dataset to find the tracks you love on the MusicBrainz database.
          <br /><br />

          We then scan this data to find the producers, guitarists, bassists (and more) that are credited in the most songs in your library.
